OAuth 2.0 Video => 

Zomato => login with google => this is called authorization and not authentication => this is Oauth = authorization

It has 4 elements => 1) Client which is us 2) Resourced server => where information about user is stored which is on google server 3) Resource owner => which is google 4) Authorization server => which handles what happens when login with google is selected 

Grant types => 4 => implicit, auth code, client credentials, resource owner password credentials. 

How grant type works with example of auth code =>

auth request is sent to authorization server => GET /o/oauth2/auth?redirect..... => it has these details in request: 
response_type: code => it needs a code from google 
client_id: client id of zomato as registered with google
redirect_url: which url to redirect to after auth is done 
scope: optional => email, profile => what all is needed 
state: optional => maintained between client and auth server required to maintain state between these 2
